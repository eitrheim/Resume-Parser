Jami Haberl, Executive Director 
Iowa Healthiest State Initiative  
301 Grand Avenue 
Des Moines, IA 50309 
 
 
Dear Ms. Haberl: 
 
The role of Content Marketing Coordinator merges two of my personal and professional passions: content and 
wellness. As a journalist, content creation has always been at the core of what I do — whether it is a 140 (or 
280) character tweet, an engaging video script or a 500-word blog post. I have experience crafting content for 
websites, social media, TV and more. My experience as a yoga instructor and person who maintains a healthy 
lifestyle provides me with the necessary voice for the organization. It would be my goal to spread awareness 
of the program’s goals and increase Iowans’ engagement with the Healthiest State Initiative. 
 
As a producer at the Des Moines Register, I handle all facets of content creation and distribution: 

  Writing content — including trending topics, local news stories, social media posts 
  Creating social media strategy — determining when is the best time to post and on what channels 
  SEO — monitoring keywords, A/B testing, manipulating fields within content management system  
  Executing distribution — publishing to website, social media channels and email newsletters 
  Measuring performance — using metrics to determine what worked to influence future strategies 

 
In addition, after noticing a lack of coordination within the newsroom, I revised a digital distribution document 
to help bridge the gap between when content is created and how it is distributed. I then helped train reporters 
and editors on best social media strategies and led the execution of their distribution plans. Our newsroom 
also has a social content calendar which I help manage on a day-to-day basis. I am confident I would be able to 
bring the same organizational skills and workflow prowess to the Healthiest State Initiative. 
 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions. I look forward to discussing the position 
with you further.  
 
Best, 
 
Lauren Ehrler
