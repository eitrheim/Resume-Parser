R um Building Tips for Success. \\x99 Remember that there is no one correct way to create a r um. What one person. likes, another may not. Ask for a lot of input before deciding on the r um that is. right for you.. \\x99 Keep it to one page unless you have significant experience in your field. If you do. have a two page r um, make sure they are two relatively complete pages.. \\x99 If you will be moving soon, use the two-address format.. \\x99 Keep typeface simple. It best to use Times-Roman or Arial.. \\x99 8 1/2\" x 11\" white or light colored, good quality paper is best. Avoid flashy clook. at me colors. Use matching paper for cover letter and avoid folding your r um. into a mailing envelope. Send it in a 9\" x 11\" mailing envelope.. \\x99 Justify the left margin, but not the right. It easier to read.. \\x99 Highlight important information (your name, address, and titles of jobs, major. categories) with boldface type.. \\x99 Use 11 or 12-point type. Do not use graphics unless you are in the design field.. \\x99 Save it on a computer disk. It easier to update and/or change this way. Keep. the disk safe, and make a back-up copy. Saving your r um also lets you make. targeted r um for specific positions to which you are applying.. \\x99 Everything you put in your r um is fair game for the interview. Be able to. discuss every point without having to refer to notes or ask for time to respond to. a question.. \\x99 Bring extra r um to your interview; even if you are sure your interviewer has a. copy.. \\x99 Use action words (see page 20) when describing what you have done. Examples. include: created, managed, developed, revised, presented, etc.. \\x99 Proof. Proof. Proof. One mistake generally means you re out the door. The. quality of your r um reflects the quality of your work and professionalism. If. you make a mistake on your r um, will you make a mistake in your job?. Employers will think so.. \\x99 Remember the 3-Example Rule: If you list a skill, you need to come up with three. examples to support it.. \\x99 Highlight computer/technology knowledge and skills as well as experience. . working as part of a group or team.. . 11. . 12. . Parts of the R um. Identification. This section should include your name, address, telephone numbers (home, and/or cell. phone numbers), and e-mail address. Make sure the employer can reach you, or can. leave a message easily.. . Tips. \\x99 Include area codes with all telephone numbers. \\x99 Make sure your voice mail message or e-mail address is not offensive,. unprofessional or ccutesy . Examples of UNPROFESSIONAL emails:. Studmuffin@aol.com. emilyscarletohara@hotmail.com. sexychick@yahoo.com. . Objective. The objective should tell what you can contribute and demonstrate the value you will. add to the organization. The r um material following the objective should support or. prove that you can perform the objective. If you have access to a computer, you can. easily change your job objective to suit each employment opportunity.. Having an objective is OPTIONAL. If you choose not to use an objective, make sure. you refer to the job you are targeting in your cover letter.. . Sample Strong Objectives. \\x99 A position as a General Sales Representative with Eli Lilly which will utilize my. chemistry and sales background.. \\x99 A position in data analysis where skills in mathematics, computer programming,. and deductive reasoning will contribute to new systems development.. . Sample of Weak Objectives. \\x99 Management position which will use my business administration degree and will. provide opportunities for rapid advancement and annual salary increases.. \\x99 A public relations position in which I can maximize opportunities to develop and. implement programs, organize people and events, communicate positive ideas. and images.. . 13. . Tips. \\x99 The objective should be as short as possible, and not include such phrases as. cchallenging position , cutilizing my skills , cgrowth potential , croom for. advancement , etc.. \\x99 If you are applying for a specific job opening, always use the employer job title. for that position.. \\x99 If you choose not to use an objective, use a summary statement or qualifications. section instead.. . Showcasing. There are two sections of a r um that are optional, but are excellent ways to. showcase your abilities up front. Think of them as a quick snapshot of your best talents.. This helps the employer get interested in you quickly!. . Summary Statement. When you have a number of years experience in a particular field or industry, this. statement is often used as an alternative to an objective or as an addition. It portrays a. summary of your credentials in sentence or paragraph form.. . Example. Over ten years of successful experience providing professional customer service.. Proven ability to effectively handle difficult situations. Highly motivated, energetic and. very creative.. . Qualifications. This section often appears on the r um to highlight and summarize your areas of. expertise, and your credentials, usually including 3 5 lines making reference to your. Work History, Education and Strengths or Self Management Skills.. . Examples. \\x99 Recently completed my BS degree in Mechanical Engineering. \\x99 Programming experience in Java, CTT and HTML. \\x99 Fluent in Spanish and Russian. . Tips. \\x99 Put strong statements at the beginning of your r um. The most important. information should come first.. \\x99 Don t use the word cI in any part of your resume.. . 14. . Worksheet: Showcase Your Accomplishments. Showcasing your abilities can a challenge, because most of us don t cbrag on a daily. basis. However, to successfully communicate your skills to the employer, you need to. learn how to csell yourself.. Take some time to list your accomplishments. Start now, but come back to it later,. when you ve thought of more things. Draw on all your experiences: paid, unpaid,. volunteer, and home. Once you have a list you can pick and choose what you want to. highlight.. There is no right or wrong way to do this, but try to include as much information as. possible. If you trained people, how many? The employer doesn t know your. capabilities, so your job is to educate him/her on what you can bring to the position!. . Examples. \\x99 Successfully managed $500,000 accounts receivables and reduced delinquent. accounts by 15 percent.. \\x99 Trained over 100 staff members in CPR and First Aid procedures.. \\x99 Developed 35 new accounts while maintaining 60 existing accounts.. . Accomplishments. . Keep in mind the variety of experiences you have had which can transfer to other job. duties. Following is a list of some skill areas which may help you categorize your skills.. . 15. . Skill Clusters. (Both transferable skills and special knowledge skill areas). . Accountant Management.
